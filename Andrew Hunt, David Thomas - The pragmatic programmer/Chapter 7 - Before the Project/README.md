## The Requirements Pit
__Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away....__ Antoine de St. Exupery

Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.

Documenting the **reasons behind requirements** will give your team invaluable information when making daily implementation decisions.

**Work with a User to Think Like a User**

The requirements mining process is also the time to start to build a rapport with your user base, learning their expectations and hopes for the system you are building.

__Use cases__ is a concept to capture requirements. They let you describe a particular use of the system — not in terms of user interface, but in a more abstract fashion.

Don’t be a slave to any notation; use **whatever method best** communicates the requirements with your audience.

**Track** your requirements actively. This means to have report on changes of scope — who requested a feature, who approved it, total number of requests approved, and so on.

Create and maintain a **project glossary** — one place that defines all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project. All participants in the project, from end users to support staff, **should use** the glossary to ensure consistency. This implies that the glossary needs to be **widely accessible** — a good argument for Web-based documentation.
