# Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

A Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn’t afraid to admit ignorance or error.

Don’t blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

__Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses__

__Don't live with broken windows__

Don’t leave “broken windows” (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up.

Neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

On the other hand, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinely beautiful — cleanly written, well designed, and elegant — you will likely take extra special care not to  mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there’s a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.), you don’t want to be the first one to make a mess.

__Be a catalyst for change__

Stone soup story.

__Remember the big picture__

Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time.

The frog’s problem is different from the broken windows issue. In the Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive that no one else cares. The frog just doesn’t notice the change.

Don’t be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.
