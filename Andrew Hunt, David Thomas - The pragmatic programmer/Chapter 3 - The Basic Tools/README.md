# Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools

## Plain Text
Always be on the lookout for better ways of doing things.

__Keep Knowledge in Plain Text__

The power of text:
- **Insurance against obsolescence**. Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data,  will outlive all other forms of data and the applications that created them.
- **Leverage**. Virtually every tool on the computing universe can operate on plain text.
- **Easier testing**. Simple matter to add, update, or modify the test data without
having to create any special tools to do so.

## Shell Games
For a programmer manipulating files of text, that workbench is the command shell. The command line is better suited when you want to quickly combine a couple of commands to perform a query or some other task.

**Invest some energy in becoming familiar with your shell** and things will soon start falling into place. Play around with your command shell, and youâ€™ll be surprised at how much more productive it makes you.
