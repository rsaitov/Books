# Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools

## Plain Text
Always be on the lookout for better ways of doing things.

__Keep Knowledge in Plain Text__

The power of text:
- **Insurance against obsolescence**. Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data,  will outlive all other forms of data and the applications that created them.
- **Leverage**. Virtually every tool on the computing universe can operate on plain text.
- **Easier testing**. Simple matter to add, update, or modify the test data without
having to create any special tools to do so.

## Shell Games
For a programmer manipulating files of text, that workbench is the command shell. The command line is better suited when you want to quickly combine a couple of commands to perform a query or some other task.

**Invest some energy in becoming familiar with your shell** and things will soon start falling into place. Play around with your command shell, and you’ll be surprised at how much more productive it makes you.

Use Cygwin([https://www.cygwin.com]) to reach Unix-like utilities and functions.

## Power Editing
It is better to know one editor very well. If you use a single editor (or set of  eybindings) across all text editing activities, you don’t have to stop and think to  accomplish text manipulation: the necessary keystrokes will be a reflex.

Editor's feeatures:
- Configurable.
- Extensible.
- Programmable.

## Source Code Control
With a properly configured source code control system, you can always go back to a previous version of your software. You can maange branches in the development tree. SCCS may keep files in the central repository - a great candidate for archiving.

**Always Use Source Code Control**

One tremendous hidden feature of using SCCS - you can have product builds that are __automatic__ and __repeatable__. There're no manual procedures, and you won't need developers remembering to copy code into some special build area.
